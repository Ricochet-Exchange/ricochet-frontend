#### Project structure

- `components` - contains react components. They can't have own state and business logic. Should be developed in storybook.
- `containers` - containers use components, adding business logic for them
- `store` - all data and global business logic placed here. Separate folder for each reducer
- `utils` - common functions for project
- `hooks` - common business logic, that can be reused between containers.

#### Configuring project

See `.env` file for configuration:

```dotenv
REACT_APP_API_GRATH=https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/superfluid-finance/superfluid-matic
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=137
```
